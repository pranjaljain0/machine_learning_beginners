# Machine Leadning Notebook

This notebook consists of the programs from the beginning of learning machine learning

## Contents

### 1. Iris dataset
###### ml_01.py
   
   In this program First I have summarized the dataset, then created a validation dataset by dividing it into 80:20 ratio, Then by selecting the best model i made predictions and evaluted those predictions.

### 2. SARS 2003 Outbreak Complete Dataset dataset
###### ml_02.py
   
   The file contains SARS number outbreak confirmed cases, deaths, recovered from March to July 2003 across the world.

### 3. Wine Quality Dataset
###### ml_03.py
   
   The Wine Quality Dataset involves predicting the quality of white wines on a scale given chemical measures of each wine.

   It is a multi-class classification problem, but could also be framed as a regression problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 4,898 observations with 11 input variables and one output variable

### 4. Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset
###### ml_04.py
   
   The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset involves predicting the onset of diabetes within 5 years in Pima Indians given medical details.

   It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Missing values are believed to be encoded with zero values
